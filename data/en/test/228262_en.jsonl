In that regard, as the applicants moreover argue under the third plea (see paragraph 97 below), Article 12(4) of that regulation does not provide for an evaluation by the Commission of the individual conduct of the establishments as such, but only an assessment of the reliability of the guarantees provided in respect of them by the competent authorities. That reliability may be cast into doubt on account of the shortcomings observed in the organisation and operation of those authorities, but also in the light of the action taken by them when they have to deal with cases of non-compliance, on the part of individual establishments, with the requirements laid down in Article 12(2)(a) of the same regulation.

First, EU law provides that the export of products of animal origin to the EU market is conditional upon the third country in question being included on the list provided for in Article 11 of Regulation No 854/2004. Second, the inclusion of establishments belonging to the applicants on the lists provided for in Article 12 of that regulation is made not by an EU institution, body or agency, but solely by the authorities of the third country concerned, exclusively for the purposes of the operation of the system of guarantees set out in paragraphs 23 to 34 above with regard, in particular, to its second aspect described in paragraphs 28 to 30, 33 and 34 above.", "label": [[229, 247, "LOC"], [337, 339, "LOC"], [403, 405, "LOC"], [421, 423, "LOC"], [489, 491, "LOC"], [775, 777, "LOC"]]}

Consequently, they consider the establishments belonging to them to be in a comparable situation, in the light of the criteria set out in recitals 4 and 5 of the contested implementing regulation, to that of those other establishments.

{"text": "127 It must be recalled that the applicants are requesting the Court to annul the contested implementing regulation, by virtue of which 12 establishments belonging to them have been removed from the lists at issue. It is apparent from the analysis of the third plea, however, that that implementing regulation could validly be adopted in view of the reason relating to the case of fraud mentioned in recital 6 thereof, connected with the forgery of Brazilian laboratory certificates (see paragraphs 107, 108 and 124 above). By their fourth plea, the applicants claim that the Commission infringed the principle of non-discrimination in relying on the other reason invoked by the Commission to adopt the contested implementing regulation, namely that of the number of RASFF notifications issued concerning the presence of salmonella in poultry meat (recitals 4 and 5 of that implementing regulation). Thus, supposing that the Commission had to take the view that the guarantees provided by the Brazilian authorities in respect of other establishments in that third country were not reliable, either, that circumstance would in no way affect the legality of that implementing regulation as regards the establishments belonging to the applicants.", "label": [[59, 68, "ORG"], [449, 458, "LOC"], [572, 586, "ORG"], [675, 689, "ORG"], [767, 772, "ORG"], [921, 935, "ORG"], [993, 1002, "LOC"]]}

Second, according to the applicants, the investigations into the case of fraud referred to in recital 6 of the contested implementing regulation concern only one establishment belonging to them, while the investigations into another case mentioned by the Commission in its defence concern only four establishments belonging to them, of which only one exported poultry meat and poultry meat preparations to the European Union, and only in small quantities.", "label": [[233, 235, "LOC"], [592, 606, "ORG"], [747, 765, "LOC"]]}

Given the fact that, as is apparent from the analysis of the third plea, the Commission’s assessments relating to the unreliability of the guarantees in question due to the case of fraud linked to the falsification of Brazilian laboratory certificates relating to the quality of meat are not vitiated by illegality, the removal of the establishments belonging to the applicants from the lists at issue is the measure which the Commission is required to take, in accordance with Article 12(2) of Regulation No 854/2004, read in conjunction with 12(4)(c) thereof.
