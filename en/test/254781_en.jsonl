In the Council’s submission, the automatic character of the renewal of the entitlement at issue vis-à-vis each of the parties to the Agreement cannot preclude any kind of internal decision-making procedure since, given that the duration of that entitlement is limited to three years, a decision needs to be taken every three years in accordance with the appropriate internal decision-making procedures.

In its submission, first, renewal of the entitlement at issue extends the temporal application of the provisions relating to that entitlement, which constitute a specific and autonomous component of the Protocol and, conversely, failure to renew that entitlement essentially amounts to depriving those provisions of legal effects.

That restriction is legitimate given that Article 218(7) TFEU constitutes a derogation from Article 218(5), (6) and (9) TFEU and renewal of the entitlement at issue is one of the measures by which policy of the European Union is made and its external action is elaborated.
