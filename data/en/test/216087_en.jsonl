{"text": "– By contrast, if the breach is uncovered during the contractor selection stage the consequences are more extreme, as the tenderer is then excluded.", "label": []}
{"text": "25. The referring court has doubts as to whether this dual treatment is compatible with Directive 2014/24. In order to answer its questions, I believe that we first need to examine whether it is permissible under Article 57 of that directive for a breach by a subcontractor to constitute grounds for excluding a tenderer, before going on to ascertain whether such an exclusion is possible under the provisions on subcontracting in Article 71 of that directive.", "label": []}
{"text": "26. In both cases, the background to Tim’s exclusion is failure (by the subcontractor) to comply with social or labour law obligations — specifically, failure to comply with national regulations on the employment of disabled persons.", "label": [[37, 42, "ORG"]]}
{"text": "27. Article 18(2) of Directive 2014/24 requires Member States (7) to take appropriate measures to ensure that in the performance of public contracts economic operators comply with their obligations in the fields of social and labour law (amongst others), as established in national law.", "label": []}
{"text": "28. This requirement applies both to main contractors and to subcontractors, since both groups are economic operators. In this way, the EU legislator sought to use administrative procurement as a tool to achieve certain other public interest objectives, and this is reflected in Articles 57 and 71 of Directive 2014/24.", "label": [[136, 138, "LOC"]]}
{"text": "29.

{"text": "B. The interpretation of Article 57(4)(a) of Directive 2014/24", "label": []}
{"text": "30. The EU legislator makes a link between Article 18(2) of Directive 2014/24 and the optional ground for exclusion in Article 57(4)(a) of that directive. This latter provision refers specifically to breach of the obligations that apply under the former provision.", "label": [[8, 10, "LOC"]]}
{"text": "31. The question is whether the behaviour of the subcontractor can justify the (optional) exclusion of the tenderer, or whether the tenderer can be excluded only on grounds of actions attributable to the tenderer itself.", "label": []}
{"text": "32. An examination of the wording of Article 57(4)(a) of Directive 2014/24 reveals that it is deliberately generic. It uses an impersonal expression (in Spanish, ‘se ha[ya]n incumplido obligaciones’) (9) to refer to breach of social or labour obligations, without specifying who has perpetrated those breaches. Viewed literally, this provision thus contrasts with other provisions that identify who is responsible for behaviour that constitutes grounds for exclusion.", "label": [[153, 160, "NATIONALITY"]]}
{"text": "33. Under this grammatical construction it is therefore possible for the breach (and, consequently, the ground for exclusion) to have been committed by the subcontractor which, as a party that employs workers on its account in the course of the public contract, is subject to national rules of social or labour law.", "label": []}
{"text": "34. If one adopts a systematic approach to interpretation, attributing a breach committed by the subcontractor to the tenderer during the initial selection stage is consistent with recital 40 of Directive 2014/24, which states that ‘control of the observance of the environmental, social and labour law provisions should be performed at the relevant stages of the procurement procedure’. (10)", "label": []}
{"text": "35. Applying this approach, Article 57(5) of Directive 2014/24 confirms that any economic operator (which therefore includes the tenderer) may be excluded ‘in view of acts committed or omitted either before or during the procedure’. Failure by the tenderer to carry out checks when it includes in its tender a subcontractor that has breached the obligations in Article 18(2) is, at the very least, a case of negligent omission.", "label": []}
{"text": "36. Finally, Article 71(6)(a) of Directive 2014/24 refers explicitly, in connection with the application of Article 18(2), to ‘joint liability between subcontractors and the main contractor’ as one of the mechanisms that may be used by Member States.", "label": []}
{"text": "37. Recital 105 of Directive 2014/24 reiterates that both parties are liable, in that it authorises the Member State to establish ‘a mechanism of joint liability between subcontractors and the main contractor’. It is well known that an action to require joint obligors to perform their obligations and to enforce the consequences of breach can be brought against any of the obligors, regardless of the internal relationship that holds between them.", "label": []}
{"text": "38. The objective of Article 57(4)(a) of Directive 2014/24 provides support for this approach, which I believe is the most appropriate in the light of the EU legislator’s clear intention to safeguard social and labour rights by also strengthening protection for these rights in the field of public procurement.", "label": [[155, 157, "LOC"]]}
{"text": "39. The desire to ensure fair competition between tenderers also points in the same direction. Competition would be distorted if, while others complied with the rules, one tenderer were to submit its tender in the knowledge that one of its main elements (the subcontractor to which it intended to entrust a significant part of the contract) had an illegal cost advantage precisely because it did not comply with its social obligations. This would affect the credibility of the tenderer which sought to exploit this unfair advantage.", "label": []}
{"text": "40. Once this premiss has been established, then logically the tenderer’s suitability as a contractor could be affected by breaches committed by the subcontractor. Given that it is the tenderer that decides of its own volition to use the subcontracting mechanism and that selects and proposes the subcontractors to be involved in performing the contract, there is no reason why the tenderer’s liability should not extend to cover the conduct of those subcontractors in respect of that contract (even if only on grounds of culpa in eligendo).", "label": []}
{"text": "41. Moreover, ploys designed to avoid liability and achieve an unjustified reduction in the main contractor’s labour costs are not uncommon in the field of administrative subcontracting, and they can take shape even during the initial (tender) stage of the procurement.", "label": []}
{"text": "42. It is true that, in its general approach to administrative procurement, EU law attaches great importance to ensuring freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services, and to encouraging competition between economic operators. This objective is facilitated by opening up procurement procedures as widely as possible, and could be hampered by excessive use of the optional grounds for exclusion.", "label": [[76, 78, "LOC"]]}
{"text": "43. However, the optional grounds for exclusion enable Member States to satisfy public interest objectives and are, in any event, intended to ensure the reliability, diligence, professional honesty and responsibility of the tenderer. (11)", "label": []}
{"text": "44. As I noted in my Opinion in Delta Antrepriză de Construcţii şi Montaj 93, (12) Directive 2014/24 includes reliability as a key element of the relationship. Under the first paragraph of recital 101, contracting authorities may exclude ‘economic operators which have proven unreliable’. The element of reliability thus imbues the grounds for exclusion concerning the status of both the tenderer and the other economic operators which the tenderer intends to use as subcontractors to perform the contract.", "label": [[32, 73, "ORG"]]}
{"text": "45. Article 57(4)(a) of Directive 2014/24 is not immune from this influence. Indeed, recital 101 begins with a reference to the unreliability of the economic operator prompted precisely by violations of ‘environmental or social obligations, including rules on accessibility for disabled persons’.", "label": []}
{"text": "46. The case-law of the Court of Justice allows Member States considerable discretion in configuring the optional grounds for exclusion. (13) Article 57(7) of Directive 2014/24 nevertheless makes clear that Member States shall specify the implementing conditions for those grounds ‘having regard to Union law’.", "label": [[20, 40, "ORG"], [299, 304, "LOC"]]}
{"text": "47. It seems to me that a Member State can legitimately use that discretion in order to enable its contracting authorities to use the optional ground for exclusion provided for in Article 57(4)(a) against a tenderer in situations where the breach of social or labour obligations has been committed by one of the tenderer’s proposed subcontractors.", "label": []}
{"text": "48. However, the scope to exclude the tenderer is not automatic: it will instead depend on the specific circumstances of the case, as assessed in accordance with the principles underpinning administrative procurement, including the principle of proportionality. (14)", "label": []}
{"text": "49. Under the proportionality principle, in order for offences by the subcontractor to impact so significantly on the tenderer as to prompt its exclusion from the procedure, the breaches committed by the subcontractor will generally have to be such that the contracting authority is unable to trust the tenderer. I will address this issue below.", "label": []}
{"text": "C. The interpretation of Article 71 of Directive 2014/24", "label": []}
{"text": "50. Article 71(1) of Directive 2014/24 imposes a duty on the competent authorities to ensure ‘observance of the obligations referred to in Article 18(2) by subcontractors’ (including, amongst others, social and labour obligations).", "label": []}
{"text": "51. Article 71(6) gives Member States authority so that ‘with the aim of avoiding breaches [by subcontractors] of the obligations referred to in Article 18(2), appropriate measures may be taken’.", "label": []}
{"text": "52. Some of the parties taking part in the proceedings (15) have argued that Article 71 of Directive 2014/24 does not apply to the tenderer selection stage but to the contract performance stage. In support of their argument they cite recital 105 of the directive, which refers only to the main contractor and the subcontractors, but not to tenderers.", "label": []}
{"text": "53. In my view, this terminological objection is not decisive. In fact, in addition to ‘main contractor’ (meaning ‘the economic operator to whom the public contract has been awarded’), Article 71 of Directive 2014/24 also uses the terms ‘subcontractor’, ‘tenderer’ (the person who has submitted a tender) and ‘economic operator’. This last term is the broadest, encompassing any undertaking that supplies its goods or services in the market, (16) which logically includes subcontractors.", "label": []}
{"text": "54. Recital 105 should be read in conjunction with the express references in Article 71 of Directive 2014/24 to the tenderer, main contractor and economic operators. There is therefore nothing to prevent this provision from applying both prior to the award of the contract (that is, to the tenderers) and after the award (that is, to the contractors) so that it covers the relationship between both tenderers and contractors and their subcontractors.", "label": []}
{"text": "55. Specifically, Article 71(6)(b) of Directive 2014/24, which deals specifically with the exclusion of a subcontractor for breach of the obligations referred to in Article 18(2), refers to the ‘economic operator’, and therefore it applies during both the selection stage and the contract performance stage.", "label": []}
{"text": "56. This is logical, because the information which the economic operator has to supply to the contracting authority regarding the subcontractors’ relationship to the contract is central to Directive 2014/24.

{"text": "– In the case of a non-mandatory ground for exclusion, (19) the contracting authority may require the economic operator to replace the subcontractor. As I shall explain, this is one of several measures that may be taken to guard against unsuitable subcontractors.", "label": []}
{"text": "60. In this regard, two elements of the legislation are particularly significant:", "label": []}
{"text": "– Firstly, the open formulation used in Article 71(6) of Directive 2014/24 (‘With the aim of avoiding breaches of the obligations referred to in Article 18(2), appropriate measures may be taken, such as: …’).", "label": []}
{"text": "– Second, the power for Member States to provide for ‘more stringent liability rules’ (Article 71(7)).", "label": []}
{"text": "61. Taken together, in my view, these two elements reinforce what can already be inferred from the interpretation of Article 57(4)(a) of Directive 2014/24, namely that in these circumstances Member States have the power to attribute direct liability to tenderers which have proposed subcontractors that have breached the obligations referred to in Article 18(2) of the directive.", "label": []}
{"text": "62. Indeed, the wording of Article 71(6) of Directive 2014/24 leaves the door open to the introduction of other national measures. The EU legislator has set out, purely by way of example, some of the measures that may be taken in respect of breach of social and labour obligations, such as replacing the subcontractor to which the (mandatory or optional) grounds of exclusion apply; but it does not close off other options. Under Article 71(8), Member States must specify the implementing conditions for those measures.", "label": [[135, 137, "LOC"]]}
{"text": "63. This same approach prevails in Article 71(7), when it makes provision for Member States to decide to implement ‘more stringent liability rules’ regarding subcontracting in national law. In my opinion, a reading of this paragraph shows that these rules are not limited to ‘direct payments to subcontractors’ (where the text uses the expression ‘to go further’), but may apply more generally.", "label": []}
{"text": "64. This can be inferred more clearly from recital 105 of Directive 2014/24, which states that ‘Member States remain free to provide for more stringent liability rules under national law or to go further under national law on direct payments to subcontractors’. Use of the conjunction ‘or’ shows that these are two different types of (possible) interventions.", "label": []}
{"text": "65. These powers available to Member States do not apply only to the relationship between the main contractor and its subcontractors, but may also extend to the relationship between the contracting authority and a tenderer that has submitted a tender in which it proposes to use the services of a subcontractor affected by one of the grounds for exclusion. I refer to my earlier comments on the joint liability of main contractors and subcontractors.", "label": []}
{"text": "66. Article 57 of Directive 2014/24 deals specifically with grounds for exclusion, and in referring to that provision Article 71(6) and (7) reinforces the possibility of excluding tenderers on the grounds of breaches by subcontractors which have failed to comply with the obligations referred to in Article 18(2). The exclusion of tenderers is specifically addressed in Article 57 but, I repeat, the provisions on subcontracting in Article 71 confirm that possibility.", "label": []}

{"text": "68. This categorical outcome may perhaps be incompatible with the principle of proportionality. The Court of Justice ruled on the optional grounds of exclusion in connection with Directive 2004/18 (20) and ruled out their automatic application. It can be concluded from the judgment in Forposta and ABC Direct Contact (21) that automatic application might exceed the limits of the discretion granted to Member States by Article 45(2) of Directive 2004/18 (now Article 57(7) of Directive 2014/24).", "label": [[96, 116, "ORG"], [286, 294, "ORG"], [299, 317, "ORG"]]}
{"text": "69. That judgment held that ‘a specific and individual assessment of the conduct of the economic operator concerned’ (22) must be carried out. The Court of Justice ruled that provisions of national legislation that ‘require the contracting authority … to exclude an economic operator from a … procedure for the award of a contract … without allowing the contracting authority the power to assess, on a case-by-case basis, the gravity of the allegedly wrongful conduct of that operator …’ were incompatible with EU law, because they did not comply with that requirement.", "label": [[143, 163, "ORG"], [511, 513, "LOC"]]}
{"text": "70. However, in Connexxion Taxi Services the Court of Justice did not follow that case-law, which had been followed in previous judgments. In weighing up the (previously mandatory) requirement for a tenderer’s offence to be assessed under the proportionality principle against respect for the principles of transparency and equal treatment, the Court came down in favour of the latter. It concluded that the latter principles took precedence in a case where, according to the ‘tender conditions of [the] contract, a tenderer which has been guilty of grave professional misconduct must necessarily be excluded, without consideration of the proportionality of that sanction’.

{"text": "72. Neither the order for reference nor the subsequent clarification (24) indicates that the requirement for automatic exclusion was included in the documents governing the award of the contract. It will be for the national court to decide whether Clause 11, or any other clause in the tender specifications, included such a mandatory requirement. If it did, the principles of transparency and equal treatment of tenderers, as set out in the Connexxion Taxi Services judgment, (25) will take precedence, thereby ensuring that a tenderer which complied with the tender specifications is not passed over in favour of someone who breached the requirements.", "label": [[442, 466, "ORG"]]}
{"text": "73. If the requirement for automatic exclusion was not included in the tender documentation, then the demands imposed by the proportionality principle come into play.

{"text": "74. The factors to be assessed could include the point put forward by the referring court in its clarificatory submission, namely that the excluded tenderer was under no obligation to check whether the ESPD supplied by the subcontractor was correct, which could mitigate the tenderer’s negligence. The tenderer would, however, still be negligent, albeit to a lesser extent, because there was nothing to prevent it from using other means to verify the subcontractor’s non-compliance beforehand (as the contracting authority did subsequently).", "label": []}
{"text": "75. The fact that, in addition to the non-compliant subcontractor, the tenderer included two other economic operators with an unblemished record on the list of subcontractors is not enough to reduce its liability. If such a practice were to be allowed, it could encourage a form of fraud involving the designation of a non-compliant subcontractor (which, as I noted earlier, tends to have lower labour or social costs), whose services will be called upon if the irregularity goes unnoticed, and two other subcontractors which are simply there to make up the numbers.", "label": []}
{"text": "76. Nor does the fact that the tenderer could have performed the contract itself without using a subcontractor reduce its liability. Given that it was free to use the subcontracting mechanism and that it had informed the contracting authority in its tender that it intended to make use of this option and to submit a list of three subcontractors, it was responsible for ensuring that the list did not include anyone who had breached national requirements regarding the employment of disabled persons.", "label": []}
